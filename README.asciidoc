README
======

This is a grab bag of backports of various Hadoop/Avro/HBase/etc. classes for use
with CDH3.

They have been packaged under a different namespace and in some cases renamed so
as to not conflict with existing classes.


Patches
=======

HBASE-1861 - Multi-Family support for bulk upload tools
--------------------------------------------------------
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-1861

This patch is imported and has the package and classnames changed.

AVRO-593 - Avro mapreduce apis incompatible with hadoop 0.20.2
--------------------------------------------------------------
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-593

This was necessary as the HFileOutputFormat uses the newer .mapreduce
API and we have Avro container files as our input files.  

The AvroInputFormat available in avro-1.4.1 is for the .mapred API.

This patch is imported and has the package changed.
